# Why?
Unfortunately Dolphin by default has a kinda disgusting feature of copying the URL of the file when you try to copy something, and when you paste it you get something like this:
```
file:///home/nathan/Pictures/doge.jpg
```

This is obviosly (at least most of the time) not what you want, so I made that Service to copy the file content specifying the MIME type properly. So, if you press "Copy File Contents" instead of "Copy" you will get the proper file contents in your clipboard.

# Installation
### Install & Upgrade
Just clone and run ``$ ./install.sh``.

### Uninstall
Just clone and run ``$ ./install.sh uninstall``.


# KDE pls welp

KDE Documentation is disgusting, so there is probably better ways to do this, but this is what I got in some hours reverse engineering existent plugins.
